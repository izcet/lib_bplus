# LIB B-PLUS 
### Overview
A B-Plus Tree data structure library written in C

## DO NOT USE THIS CODE
This project is badly in need of a refactor (and currently doesn't compile because I redid the naming of some functions and haven't fixed the conflicts yet). 
The commit prior compiled and could store items in the tree with 95% accuracy as long as the NODE_CAPACITY was an even number 6 or greater.
I'm going to redraw the library design and rewrite it with a more top-down approach to the logic and practical usage,
and then I'm going to use the existing code as a visual reference when I rewrite it from scratch.
